### Personal Expense app 

This repository is to help demonstrate the best practices in Android Development and also the playground for me to 
try new things in development.

What are at the core of this project:

- [ ] MVI 
- [x] Purely Kotlin
- [ ] Unit test and espresso test 
- [ ] Test coverage setup with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)
- [ ] CI/CD with TravisCI
- [ ] Koin as DI. (still Dagger2 now, but will migrate to another branch to play with Hilt/Koin soon) 
- [x] Feature based structure.
